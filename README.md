# StageScribe

This project is currently on hold. It is meant to be a speech to text program used specifically for playwright documents. Currently only has basic STT functionality with a sample GUI.

Project started with the intention of creating a way to write theater-specific documents for those with loss in fine motor skills (originally for a family member).
